0,Single Burger at Everson Royce Bar,Everson Royce Bar,Single Burger ,https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/bars/everson-royce-bar,4,http://www.erbla.com,'1936 E 7th St Los Angeles 90021',"
Approaching the imposing orange door to E.R.B. (Everson Royce Bar, technically speaking), it’s hard to know what to expect behind it. The concrete exterior of the downtown Arts District haunt seems intentionally non-descript. A bold neon sign above the door reads simply “BAR”—the small plaque beside it, “everson royce bar, est. 2015,” verifies the bar’s identity. Inside, the bar is not only bustling, but bright; the large, elegant space is bathed in soft light, illuminating its features in a way that feels warm and inviting. Out back, a spacious patio offers ample seating for drinking, dining and stargazing through the twinkle of overhead light strings. The warmth of E.R.B.’s atmosphere extends to its service, too; despite a packed house, the bar felt remarkably personal. It turns out that the guy walking around like he owns the place in fact does, and he’ll deliver your drinks, to boot. Not only did co-owner Randy Clement indulge our every query about the cocktails and food, but the Silverlake Wine boss also provided some insight into the inspiration behind the bar and its predecessor, Everson Royce, a wine shop in Pasadena: they’re named after Clement’s twin sons, Everson and Royce. It wasn’t just us, and it wasn’t just him—beyond our table, we observed Clement and his staff treating every patron with the priority of a VIP. Simply put, this place knows how to make a girl feel special, and in this town, that goes a long way.
Vitals
Good for: Girl's night, date night, first date, work drinks—all of the above. With a welcoming atmosphere, excellent cocktails, an extensive selection of wine by the glass or bottle and a respectable line-up of draught, bottled and canned beers, there’s really something here for everyone. It fills a needed niche in the Arts District, plus there’s reasonable on-site valet, which is a nice alternative to parking on a dimly-lit industrial street.
The scene: This place was hopping at 9pm on a Friday night, with the patio full and nearly all the seats at the bar and indoor tables occupied. E.R.B.’s upscale yet casual vibe seems to cater to the cool and sophisticated—30+ patrons whose tattoos show that they still have an edge, but whose quiet sense of relief tells you they were lucky to get a sitter tonight. The music, too, seems to cater to a slightly older crowd; we heard at least two Garbage songs in the rotation, and we didn’t mind one bit.
Drink this: Varnish alumn Chris Ojeda adds a whole lot of credibility to the cocktail list here, and the eight concoctions he’s brought to the menu do not disappoint. There are refined standards like the Mamie Taylor ($13) with scotch, ginger and lime, and the Fancy Free ($13), an Old Fashioned variation with maraska liqueur, but the Infanté ($12), a tequila tipple with lemon, almond, nutmeg and rosewater stole our hearts with its combination of tart, sweet and lightly perfumed flavors. The Business ($12) was another favorite that Bee’s Knees fans should enjoy—lime replaces lemon in this delightful mingling of gin, citrus and honey. The Paper Plane ($13) was the most unexpected joy of the evening. Seeing bourbon, aperol and amaro in the ingredients, we expected a spirit-forward heavyweight of a cocktail, but were pleasantly surprised by the light, bright and dangerously downable creation that arrived.
Our tip: With former Osteria Mozza chef Matt Molina in the kitchen, E.R.B.’s food offerings are elevated far beyond your typical bar grub, like the steamed buns ($10), melt-in-your-mouth roasted pork belly, cucumber pickle and hoisin wrapped in pillowy warm bao. The kitchen is open til 1am, which is great if you’re feeling a bit peckish. Bear in mind that when the menu says “Bites,” it means it—if you skipped dinner, you’ll probably still end up at Jack in the Box on your way home.

1,Big Mec at Petit Trois,Petit Trois,Big Mec ,https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/restaurants/petit-trois,5,http://petittrois.com,'718 N Highland Ave Los Angeles 90038',"
To watch an omelette being made at Ludo Lefebvre’s Petit Trois is a thing of beauty.
First there is the butter, a massive pad that swirls around the pan before being flooded with whipped eggs over low heat. The mixture sits, briefly, then is taken off the stove and gently poked and prodded for minutes until it is finally folded into one uniform, buttercup-hued omelette. Oh, and did I mention that Boursin cheese is piped through the middle?
Perceived simplicity is what Chef Lefebvre aims to perfect at Petit Trois, which sits right next to his first brick-and-mortar success, Trois Mec. The menu is a sparse list of classic French dishes—steak frites, mussels marinières, chicken leg—and the playlist is '90s hip hop and classic rock, an unusual mix but one that furthers Lefebvre’s ethos of this being a casual French spot, a place to indulge in simple, good food without pretense. If the Hollywood strip mall exterior doesn’t sell you on this idea, the food certainly will.
I was not asked how I would like my steak when I ordered the steak frites, but if I had been, I would have asked for exactly what came out. Cooked medium rare, the juicy slab arrives au poivre, slathered in the traditional sauce with green peppercorns for a hit of spice and a squeeze of lemon for acidity. The accompanying fries are fantastic. It’s a dish that, as an end product, seems so basic, so why were we astounded (as with the omelette) that it tasted that good? This was a theme that continued throughout our meal, making us question if we had just been settling all along when it came to steak and eggs.
A croque monsieur, originally offered only after 10pm and now part of the full menu, is a heart attack waiting to happen (though, from a prep chef who leaned over the granite chef's counter as we ogled at the sandwich: “That’s better for you than a Big Mac.”). A mass of melted cheese sits over the top slice of bread, cooked under the broiler. The dish is comfort food, plain and simple: there is the thick, oozing Gouda; the salty slices of ham; the bread that has been soaked through with butter to create the golden toast. The real heart attack? You pay $18 for it, which led us to another existential question: Is a grilled sandwich ever worth $18? Is an omelette? What if it's the best omelette you've ever had? Lefebvre wants to channel the French bistros of his youth in an LA strip mall, and that's fine. But to ask diners to stop in for a ""dish or two, and a drink"" and then leave $70 poorer? C'est ridicule.
Still, whether it is a forkful of the chocolate cake drizzled in caramel sauce and a dusting of cocoa powder, or that last bit of omelette with its garlicy, peppery Boursin, there is no denying that Lefebvre has done his work here. Petit Trois is casual. It is French. And it is very, very good.
What to Eat: The omelet ($18). The steak frites ($36). The Croque Monsieur ($18). The chocolate cake ($10).
What to Drink: Despite his aversion to cocktails, Lefebvre has included a cocktail list along with a selection of wines and a few beer options. The cocktails, however, are far from the eight-ingredient concoctions we have come to expect. Drinks are simple, like the delightfully fresh Fleur de Mal ($12) that uses rose petal-infused vodka, ruby grapefruit and lemon to create a crisp, balanced beverage that, despite its citrus components, is neither too sour nor too sweet.
Where to Sit: There are roughly 20 bar seats at Petit Trois: you can either sit facing the kitchen or facing a mirror (there are a couple smaller tables off to the side as well). Sitting at the kitchen counter—especially when they are making that omelette—is a happy distraction as you wait for your food. The downside? You can see exactly how much butter is being used.
Conversation Piece: There is no tipping at Petit Trois. Instead, an 18% service charge is added to the bill. Oh, and cash isn’t allowed—only credit cards. This bistro may be casual, but it’s still Ludo’s house.

L.A.'s seafood guru, chef Michael Cimarusti of Providence, pays homage to his New England roots—his grandfather was a fisherman in Rhode Island—with a modern take on the clam shack. The lofty eatery in the heart of West Hollywood features alfresco dining with indoor and outdoor seating—grab a spot at the raw bar for a close-up view of the kitchen—and a constellation of ceiling lights. (Design buffs and Cimarusti fans can also admire the collage of oyster tags of 15+ years at Providence.) To eat, order from the raw bar (think: oysters, clams, lobsters, crabs, shrimp and spot prawns) or get hands-on with oysters Rockefeller or deviled oysters. Two-fisters include the lobster and clam rolls, served on a griddled top-split bun. Classic seaside plates include grilled or steamed lobster served with drawn butter, fried clams served with tartar sauce and fries, and a clam bake of mussels, steamer clams, lobster, linguiça (Portuguese sausage) and steamed potatoes and corn. Domestic craft brews are offered on tap and by the bottle, as well as a California-centric selection of reds and whites by the glass, carafe and bottle. A small list of cocktails are just as appetizing as the food (housemade coffee syrup and banana cordial, anyone?), and a perfect way to start a summer feast. Want to stop by on the weekend? Connie and Ted's also serves brunch, with dishes like biscuits and gravy, crabs and eggs, and French toast.

9,Patty Melt at Cassell's Hamburgers,Cassell's Hamburgers,Patty Melt ,https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/restaurants/cassells-hamburgers,3,http://www.cassellshamburgers.com,'3600 W 6th St Los Angeles 90020',"
Cassell’s Hamburgers is part of The Normandie Hotel’s multi-million dollar makeover, one that includes the adjacent Le Comptoir and The Normandie Club. Yet Cassell’s itself isn’t new, per se. The original diner, founded by Al Cassell in 1948 and located just a couple blocks away, was an institution, known for its burgers, patty melts and slices of pie; a Korean family bought it in 2006, running the restaurant until it closed again in 2012 (quit playing with our hearts!). Now reimagined by chef Christian Page, the relocated Cassell’s pays tribute with ‘50s memorabilia hanging on the walls and the use of the diner’s original Hobart meat grinder and patty press. A lot has changed, though, and not necessarily for the better.
The menu is basic, with variations on burgers and sandwiches that evoke lunch box staples. A lackluster tuna melt elicited indifferent shrugs around our table, which was discouraging for a $14 sandwich.  I know, I know: the tuna is wild-caught albacore soaked in pickle juice; the mayo is homemade. Still—it could use a jolt of flavor, or at least something to warrant its plumped-up price tag. Other hot, melted options are better: a patty melt uses house ground beef with a slice of cheese (your choice of cheddar or Swiss) on toasted rye, while the burger is Cassell's all-around winner. Page uses natural, hormone-free Colorado Angus, which he grinds twice a day. It shows—the beef is rich and tender without being greasy, and the Parker House bun does its job soaking up the burger's contents without falling apart. Is it one of the best burgers I’ve had in LA? Nah, but it’s a good one.
A banchan-like collection of sides came with our order, including three salads: potato salad, coleslaw, and a macaroni salad that reminded me of family picnics, in the very best way. It makes up for the fact that Cassell’s doesn’t offer French fries at the moment, a stance taken by Al Cassell, who favored chips instead. But the public wants what it wants, and our server informed us that a plan to put fries on the menu was in the works. She also offered us a second helping of our sides, which never came, so I don’t really know what to believe. I can believe in the pie here, though. The filling options change daily and involve a flaky crust, a side scoop of ice cream, and a sense of simplicity that, I think, would have pleased Cassell himself.
Vitals
What to Eat: The burger ($10.99 for 1/3 lb., $15.99 for 2/3 lb.). The patty melt ($11.99). The macaroni salad ($2.50). The mixed berry pie ($5).
What to Drink: There’s a reason diners aren’t known for their booze. Cassell’s has a hefty cocktail menu (each drink is $10), with a separate list for brunch drinks, like the Brass Monkey, a mix of Colt 45 malt liquor and OJ. We tried a couple—the Sidearm, made with Bulleit Rye and Fernet; the Root Cause, made with bourbon—but each drink was loaded with small chips of ice that quickly melted, leaving our drinks watery and weak. It’s better to go for the shakes, malts and house sodas. Sweet and bitter, sarsparilla ($3.50) is poured into a huge glass, certainly enough to last you through your meal and providing the necessary dose of nostalgia that cocktails just don’t do for a diner.
Where to Sit: Cassell’s is great for people-watching: tables are pushed up against windows that look out onto Normandie and 6th Street. There’s a counter, too, which might provide a more authentic feel—even if sipping on a watery cocktail at the counter doesn’t.

The burgers at HiHo aren't groundbreaking in flavor, but they're practically groundbreaking when it comes to sourcing: The meat is entirely wagyu, grass-fed, non-GMO and non-antibiotic, and the beef comes from cows raised by the certified-humane collective First Light Farm. The result? Tender, perfectly seared beef that almost melts on the tongue, and is easy on the conscience, too. You can go either double or triple (sorry, no singles here, unless you're opting for the house-made vegan patty), and go best with a side of those hand-cut, twice-fried fries.

Scores of hungry Angelenos line up at this stand turned casual restaurant for American classics at a bargain price.

Sure, this no-frills burger joint is vastly informal, but that just spotlights the Fat Chili Cheese Burger, Double Bacon Egg Cheese Burger, and other tasty fares that much more. If you want to give a whack at the Triple burger (that’s three fully stacked burgers piled into one tower for $8.99), go for it—but you’ll need an impressive pack of napkins (and maybe some forks) at the ready.

The paucity of authentic—even passable—Spanish dining is one of the great gaps in the L.A. restaurant scene. And, as a man who considers any time he doesn’t spend in Spain as being ever so slightly wasted, word of a new addition is always welcome. I was thrilled to hear that chef Teresa Montaño—whose excellent provenance includes time in Valencia and in the kitchen at Pasadena’s now-shuttered Ración—was planning to open Otoño in Highland Park.
It all begins well enough. The superb drinks list at Otoño includes a commendable gin-and-tonics program, and the Gin & Tonic “Classico” reflects the seriousness with which that iconic cocktail is treated in Spain (the Spaniards drink more gin than any other nation on earth). Meanwhile, a glass of briny Manzanilla came at the perfect chilled temperature. When combined with some of the well-executed standards of the Spanish bar repertoire, there’s a feeling that everything is well with the world. The Boquerones y Mantequilla ($12) elegantly combines the vinegar sharpness of Spain’s beautiful canned anchovies with a rich goat milk butter, while the Gambas a la Plancha ($18), a small plate of griddled blue prawns, came perfectly prepared with a slight char on the shell—and meat cooked to retain a bite. The Croqueta de Jamón ($6)—a fritter filled with serrano ham—and the Croqueta de Setas y Maize ($6)—stuffed with mushroom and sweet corn—are good enough to pass muster in any Madrileño bar.
Once we delved deeper into the menu, however, standards began to decline; our table dismissed the Calamares en Su Tinta ($14) as tough and slimy. Calçots ($11) are traditionally spring onions from the Catalan region, and should be eaten “sword swallower”-style after being dipped in a pungent romesco sauce. The attempt to elevate the dish at Otoño using a single, larger green onion failed, primarily because of the undercooking of the main ingredient and the blandness of the romesco with which it was topped.
Spirits improved with the arrival of the sardines ($18), a single, plump and juicy grilled French sardine served atop escalavida—a layer of smoked grilled vegetables—which combined seafood freshness with the smoky crunch of the vegetables. But, we were quickly disappointed when a tangy green peppercorn sauce couldn’t disguise the fact that the Pollo Ahumado ($20) had been overcooked.
From her time in Spain, chef Montaño will know that a true paella is something to be taken very seriously as a joyous expresser of Valencian identity, which makes it even more disappointing that the arroz dishes at Otoño could best be described as two apologetic pans of over-salted parsimony. While the toppings on both the Mariscos ($32) and the Negra ($32), particularly the scallops on the Negra, show that the kitchen really knows how to cook seafood, the lack of soccarat—that essential layer of crisp rice—and the generous salting meant that what should have been the stars of the show were sadly left unfinished. 
Desserts struggled, too. A Crema Catalana ($10) was overpowered by cinnamon, and a Caña de Cabra cheesecake ($10) had so much salt that I assume it was prepared next to the person who made the rice dishes.
It’s no surprise that a new-ish restaurant is still figuring out its systems, and much can be forgiven for the genuine amiability of the staff. What’s more difficult to explain is the blistering rapidity with which the food arrived from kitchen to table: Our second visit broke records as every dish we ordered was piled onto the table within 20 minutes of ordering, despite requests to staff to slow things down. 
It’s a failing that is often enough to make me cross a restaurant off my list of regulars, but at Otoño it merely served to confirm my regretful belief that the restaurant is, for now, too inconsistent to plug that yawning Spanish gap in the Los Angeles food scene, and certainly doing little to dampen the serious Spain jones of yours truly. I shall continue to wait, although more in hope than expectation.



VITALS
WHERE TO SIT
Otoño is small enough that one table is more or less like any other another, so, arrive early and snag a seat at the bar—that’s where all the action seems to happen.
WHAT TO EAT
For the time being, Otoño best serves as a tapas-only destination. The Pan con Tomate ($5) here has just the right amount of garlic kick; order the Boquerones y Mantequilla; and the Conserva de Atún ($12), house-cured tuna, provides the perfect accompaniment to a glass of Fino. 
WHAT TO DRINK
In addition to the gin and tonics, there’s a sherry selection that not only offers versions across all the appropriate categories, but each is also served at the right temperature. The wine list offers bottles and glasses from some of Spain’s most well-known and lesser-known producing regions, and there’s a list of digestifs that offers Patxaran, a beloved Basque liquor, as well as some of the most wonderful but liver-shuddering brandies that have provided the end to far too many of my nights in Spain.

Fred and Max Guerrero grew up obsessed with burgers as the kids of the founder of local fast-casual burger chain Oinkster.
